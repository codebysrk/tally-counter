# tally-counter
A beautifully designed, fully responsive digital counter component with a calculator-style display. Built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this counter mimics the look and feel of a physical device — including soft shadows, glossy highlights, disabled button states, and a tactile button press effect.
